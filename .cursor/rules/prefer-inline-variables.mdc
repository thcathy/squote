# Prefer Inline Variables

When writing Java code, prefer using inline variables and expressions to reduce unnecessary variable declarations and improve code readability.

## Guidelines:
- Inline simple expressions instead of creating temporary variables
- Use method chaining when appropriate to avoid intermediate variables
- Inline variables that are only used once immediately after declaration
- Avoid creating variables for simple calculations or transformations
- Still create variables when they improve readability or are used multiple times
